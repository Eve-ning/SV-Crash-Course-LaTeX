\subsection{What does SV actually stand for}
Slider Velocity, or more representative of mania, Scroll Velocity. But never Speed Velocity.
\subsection{What you need to know before learning starting to read this document}
You just need basic knowledge of Mathematics and preferably understanding of the “Distance, Time and Speed” concept.
\subsection{Why SVs are important in mapping/modding}
Modding-wise, you’re most likely going to face a challenge of modding an SV-oriented map, if you understand how to use it, you’ll understand how to fix it.

Mapping-wise, most mappers take it as a choice to use it or not, some seasoned mappers probably haven’t touched it.
The only part where you need SVs is when you start to encounter multi-BPM charts, you’ll definitely need to utilize normalization only achieve-able in SVs.
